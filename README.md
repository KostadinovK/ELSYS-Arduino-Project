# ELSYS-Arduino-Project
My project for the Arduino course in ELSYS - 11th grade 2018/2019

A Bulls and Cows "game console". Basically playing agains the computer, trying to guess his number.

In order to work you need to import the libraries in the "libs" folder to your Arduino libraries. Just copy-paste the folders inside "libs" to "Documents/Arduino/libraries".
