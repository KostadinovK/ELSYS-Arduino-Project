# ELSYS-Arduino-Project
My project for the Arduino course in ELSYS - 11th grade 2018/2019

A OOP "game console". Basically you can play two games for now - "Bulls And Cows" and the Chrome Dinosaur game.

In order to work you need to import the libraries in the "libs" folder to your Arduino libraries. Just copy-paste the folders inside "libs" to "Documents/Arduino/libraries".

Feel free to write your own games! Have fun!
